# 🗑️ Trash Classification using Deep Learning (TrashNet Project)

Welcome to the Trash Classification project! This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for classifying waste into various categories like **paper**, **plastic**, **glass**, **metal**, and **cardboard**. Proper waste classification is essential for effective recycling and environmental sustainability.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `trashnet_project_updated.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project overview, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies (to be added).

## 🧠 Model Summary

The project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image classification. Key steps include:
- Data loading and preprocessing using Keras/TensorFlow
- CNN model building
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix)
- Model improvement techniques (augmentation, dropout)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the **TrashNet** dataset, which contains images of trash across several categories:
- **Cardboard**
- **Glass**
- **Metal**
- **Paper**
- **Plastic**

> Dataset Source: [TrashNet Dataset by Stanford](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib seaborn numpy pandas scikit-learn

Running the Notebook
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
